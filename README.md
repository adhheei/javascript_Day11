# 📅 Day 11: Promises & Promise Methods
📖 Learn

Understand the need for Promises — why and when they are used in JavaScript.

Learn how Promises help manage asynchronous operations more effectively compared to callbacks.

Study deeply, as Promises are widely used in real-world JavaScript and API handling.

💻 Code Task

Create dummy APIs using fetch() and handle their responses with Promises.

Practice handling both resolved and rejected states to strengthen your async handling skills.

🔁 Revise

Review the major Promise utility methods:

Promise.all() – Waits for all promises to resolve.

Promise.any() – Returns the first fulfilled promise.

Promise.allSettled() – Waits for all promises to settle (resolve or reject).

Promise.race() – Returns the first settled promise (resolved or rejected).

🧠 Key Takeaway

Promises are the foundation of modern asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
Understanding them thoroughly will help you work efficiently with APIs, async/await, and real-world async workflows.
